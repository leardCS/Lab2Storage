# Lab2Storage

Using Java, I imported data from a CSV file that contains artists' appearances in the Spotify Top 200 Weekly chart of the week 9/03/2020.

To create organization, I removed the duplicate entries and counted how many times an Artist appeared on the Top 200, not including features.
This information was exported to the Report.txt file.
