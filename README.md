# Lab2Storage

Using Java, I imported data from the CSV file("spotifyDataLog.csv") that contains artists' appearances on the Spotify Top 200 weekly chart of the week 9/03/2020.

To create organization, I removed duplicate entries and counted how many times an Artist appeared on the Top 200, not including features.
This information was exported to a text file("Report.txt").
